## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my page! My name is Sophie Tessier. I'm currently in my second-to-last term of my Master's program, obtaining my degree in Library and Information Science. I've recently accepted a position as a reference librarian at a law library in downtown Philadelphia, and am so excited to get started!

One topic of interest to me is [digital preservation](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica.git)
